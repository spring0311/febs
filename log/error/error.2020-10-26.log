2020-10-26 08:54:26 ERROR http-nio-8081-exec-6 cc.mrbird.febs.common.handler.GlobalExceptionHandler AuthorizationException, This subject is anonymous - it does not have any identifying principals and authorization operations require an identity to check against.  A Subject instance will acquire these identifying principals automatically after a successful login is performed be executing org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject.login(AuthenticationToken) or when 'Remember Me' functionality is enabled by the SecurityManager.  This exception can also occur when a previously logged-in Subject has logged out which makes it anonymous again.  Because an identity is currently not known due to any of these conditions, authorization is denied.
